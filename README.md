# Movie Logger Client

Create an account, sign in, and use this app to keep track of all the movies you have watched and what you thought of them!

# Movie Logger Client dev process

Started by making sure the app is connected to the api so that users can create accounts and add movies in a user friendly way. When I hit issues I used research and other classmates to get through building the front end. There are many more styling choices that must be made in the future for this site. 


## Deployed sites
