  - As a user, see a list of movies seen and want to be seen.

  - As a user, I want to see how many times I have seen a movie and if I liked it.

  - As a returning user, I want to be able to see how many movies I have seen (this year?).

  - As a returning user, I want to be able to rate movies.

  - As a returning user, I want to be able to log out so that other people can't see my stats.
